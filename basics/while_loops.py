This is a while loop file
Coding with Mosh
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
"""
i = 1
# The following code prints numbers 1 to 5
while i <= 5:  # i <= 5 is a comparison and <= is a comparison operator
    print(i)
    # the following is an assignment similar to i = i + 1
    i += 1


# print a triangle shape using *
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i * "*")  # multiply the string by the value of i
    i += 1
